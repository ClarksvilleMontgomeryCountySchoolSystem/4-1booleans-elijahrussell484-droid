# REFLECTION: Discuss with your partner
# Which variable names were easiest to work with? Why?
'''#is_wearing_shoes was the easiest to work with because the variable is 
asking if we are wearing shoes and we are, so we answered true.'''
# Which were most confusing? Why?
''''#not_in_front was the most confusing because the variable 
does not say the location of where we are or not close to. If we didn't have the question 
we wouldn't know if we were close to where it was asking about or not.'''
